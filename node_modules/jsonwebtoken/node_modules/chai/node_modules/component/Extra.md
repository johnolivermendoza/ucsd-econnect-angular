# About Duo.js
[Duo](https://github.com/duojs/duo) is an evolution of Component, which aims to solve some of the problems that were not addressed in the 1.0 release of Component. To quote Duo's FAQ:

> While the release of Component 1.0 solved a lot of the initial gripes with earlier versions of Component, in the end we were after a more radical departure from Component that borrowed some good ideas from Browserify.

Component's `component.json` should be compatible with Duo's interpretation of component.js
