Before contribute something:

Follow simple rules:

- Not violate [DRY](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Don%27t_Repeat_Yourself).
- [Boy Scout Rule](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Boy_Scout_Rule) needs to have been applied.

1. Your code should look like all the other code - this project should look like it was written by one man, always.
2. If you want to propose something - just create an issue and describe your question with as much description as you can.
